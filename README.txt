5 Steps to Write Better Commit Messages
Let's summarize the suggested guidelines:

Capitalization and Punctuation: Capitalize the first word and do not end in punctuation. If using Conventional Commits, remember to use all lowercase.
Mood: Use imperative mood in the subject line. Example – Add fix for dark mode toggle state. Imperative mood gives the tone you are giving an order or request.
Type of Commit: Specify the type of commit. It is recommended and can be even more beneficial to have a consistent set of words to describe your changes. Example: Bugfix, Update, Refactor, Bump, and so on. See the section on Conventional Commits below for additional information.
Length: The first line should ideally be no longer than 50 characters, and the body should be restricted to 72 characters.
Content: Be direct, try to eliminate filler words and phrases in these sentences (examples: though, maybe, I think, kind of). Think like a journalist.

The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
You modify files in your working directory.
You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.
You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.
To stage a file is simply to prepare it finely for a commit. Git, with its index allows you to commit only certain parts of the changes you’ve done since the last commit.

Say you’re working on two features – one is finished, and one still needs some work done. You’d like to make a commit and go home but wouldn’t like to commit the parts of the second feature, which is not done yet. You stage the parts you know belong to the first feature, and commit.

Now your commit is your project with the first feature done, while the second is still in work-in-progress in your working directory.

What is Semantic Versioning (SemVer)"
1. Introduction
SemVer is a popular versioning scheme that is used by a vast amount of open-source projects to communicate the changes included in a version release. As developers, it’s important for us to understand how to use SemVer in our own projects and also how to interpret a specific version change.

This tutorial will provide a guide to the main concepts of the SemVer specification.
